### Build

To build the plugin locally, make sure to have yarn installed and run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:salesforcecli/plugin-login

# Install the dependencies and compile
yarn install
yarn build
```

To use your plugin, run using the local `./bin/run` or `./bin/run.cmd` file.

```bash
# Run using local run file.
./bin/run login
```

There should be no differences when running via the Salesforce CLI or using the local run file. However, it can be useful to link the plugin to do some additional testing or run your commands from anywhere on your machine.

```bash
# Link your plugin to the sfdx cli
sf plugins:link .
# To verify
sf plugins
```
