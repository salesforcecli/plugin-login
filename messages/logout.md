# summary

Log out interactively from environments, such as Salesforce orgs and compute environments.

# description

By default, the command prompts you to select which environments you want to log out of. Use --no-prompt to not be prompted and log out of all environments.

Be careful! If you log out of a scratch org without having access to its password, you can't access the scratch org again, either through the CLI or the Salesforce UI.

# examples

- Interactively select the environments to log out of:

  <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %>

- Log out of all environments, without being prompted:

  <%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --no-prompt
